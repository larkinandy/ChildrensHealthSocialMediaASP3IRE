### database_setup
Analyze social media records to gain insights into children's environmental health

**Summary** <br>
This github repository contains python scripts and custom classes for ingesting social media records into a Neo4j database and researching attitudes, perceptions, behaviors, and children's environmental health social media misinformation.

**Repository Structure** <br>
Files are divided into five folders, with each folder corresponding to a unique stage of the research pipeline

- **[database setup](https://github.com/larkinandy/ChildrensHealthSocialMediaASP3IRE/tree/master/database_setup)** - ingest records from X (formerly Twitter) and GIS datasets into a Neo4j database. Additional operations include processing social media records (e.g. georeferencing records) <br>
- **[deep learning](https://github.com/larkinandy/ChildrensHealthSocialMediaASP3IRE/tree/master/deep_learning)** - multimodal models for extracting information from X text and imagery <br>
- **[analysis](https://github.com/larkinandy/ChildrensHealthSocialMediaASP3IRE/tree/master/analysis)** - analyzing records for trends related to children's environmental health. <br>
- **[website](https://github.com/larkinandy/ChildrensHealthSocialMediaASP3IRE/tree/master/website)** - interactive website for viewing analysis results. <br>
