# Analysis
Results from analyzing the performance of deep learning models and workers who labeled the training dataset

**Summary** <br>
Analyses are stored in Excel files. Scripts used to perform statistical analyses are not included, as all derived metrics (e.g. accuracy, precision) are widely known.

**Repository Structure** <br>
Analyses are divided into 4 Excel files.

- **[Twitter_Labeling_QA_Analysis](https://github.com/larkinandy/ChildrensHealthSocialMediaASP3IRE/tree/master/deep_learning/create_training_dataset/analysis/Twitter_Labeling_QA_Analysis)** - QA performance for each worker that labeled tweets, stratified by deep learning model label.<br>
- **[Place_Model_Performance](https://github.com/larkinandy/ChildrensHealthSocialMediaASP3IRE/tree/master/deep_learning)** - Training and validation performance for canddiate model architectures predicting 'safe places'.<br>
- **[Child_Model_Performance](https://github.com/larkinandy/ChildrensHealthSocialMediaASP3IRE/tree/master/analysis)** - Training and validation performance for candidate model architectures predicting children present and age groups. <br>
- **[Health_Model_Performance](https://github.com/larkinandy/ChildrensHealthSocialMediaASP3IRE/tree/master/website)** - Training and validation performance for candidate model architecxtures predicting physical, mental, and cognitive health symptoms and outcomes. <br>


TODO:
- add Place model performance excel file
- add Child model performance excel file
- add health model performance excel file
- add summary figure/graph/table
